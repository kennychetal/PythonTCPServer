# Python QT4 TCP Server
#### Basic TCP server that can pretty much be used for anything and is reasonably stable.
 Developed in Summer 2012 to handle web requests, and do M2M communication. Feel free to try it out.

##Setup
#####1. If you don't have qt installed you will need to run the following commands in linux:
   - sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
   - sudo apt-get install python-qt4 qt4-dev-tools python-qt4-dev pyqt4-dev-tools

#####2. Once installed you can run the tcp server with the following command in your directory where the files are located: 
     python main.py

#####3. Have Fun!
